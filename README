Troll App for Android
=====================

This document explains how to use the Troll Android application 
on an Android emulator or device.

This release supports ARM, x86 and MIPS based Android systems.

I. Building the project:
========================

This project contains a google maps application and requires the linkage of
certain libraries, specifically google_play_services_library. There's an
additional supporting file "appcompat_v7" that needs to be included in the 
workspace and linked to the Troll App project.
 
I.1. Building with Eclipse and google-play-services:
----------------------------------------------------

If you haven't already downloaded the google play services from the Android
SDK Manager, to do so;

1. Find the "Android SDK Manager" under the "Window" menu in Eclipse. 
2. Once you have opened the "Android SDK Manager", under the "Extras"
   folder, you can find "Google Play Services". 
3. Install Google Play Services onto your computer, and make note of the 
   location of the google-play-services folder on your computer.
4. Once you have done so, please import the 2 enclosed folders from within
   the zip file into your workspace. These two files are "TrollApp" and 
   "appcompat_v7".
5. Right click and browse for the google-play-services and import it into the 
   workspace. 
6. Right click on the "Troll" folder and click properties. Under the Android
   tab, find the section where it says "Library". 
7. Make sure to add both "appcompat_v7" and "google-play-services" in the
   Library section, and make sure that the "Is Library" radio button is 
   unchecked.

NOTE: Make sure that the 2 libraries in the library sections have green 
      check marks next to them. If for some reason they have a red 'X' instead,
      then be sure to remove the library with the red 'X' and re-add it into
      the library section.

I.2. Running the project
------------------------

To run the project, make sure you have Genymotion installed and an emulator
session is initiated. The application is designed to work with any Android
API between level 9 (Gingerbread) and level 19 (Kit Kat).
